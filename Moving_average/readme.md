## Theory: Moving Averages in Trading

Moving averages are one of the most widely used technical indicators in financial trading. They help traders identify trend direction, spot potential support and resistance levels, and generate trading signals when combined with other indicators.

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of a set of values over a specific number of periods:

```
SMA = (P₁ + P₂ + ... + Pₙ) / n
```

Where:
- P₁, P₂, ..., Pₙ are the price values
- n is the number of periods (window size)

For a 10-point moving average (as implemented in this system), we sum the last 10 price points and divide by 10:

```
SMA₁₀ = (P₁ + P₂ + ... + P₁₀) / 10
```

When a new price point arrives, the oldest price is removed from the calculation, and the new price is added:

```
SMA₁₀(new) = SMA₁₀(old) - (Pₒₗₐₑₛₜ / 10) + (Pₙₑₗₑₛₜ / 10)
```

Alternatively, and more efficiently (as implemented in our system), we can use a rolling sum approach:

```
Sum(new) = Sum(old) - Pₒₗₐₑₛₜ + Pₙₑₗₑₛₜ
SMA₁₀(new) = Sum(new) / 10
```

This approach requires only two arithmetic operations (one addition, one subtraction) per update, plus a division, regardless of the window size.

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) gives more weight to recent prices and less weight to older prices:

```
EMA = Price(t) × k + EMA(y) × (1 - k)
```

Where:
- Price(t) is the current price
- EMA(y) is the EMA from the previous period
- k = 2 ÷ (n + 1), where n is the number of periods

While our current implementation focuses on SMA, the architecture could be extended to support EMA calculations with modifications to the computational logic.

### Weighted Moving Average (WMA)

The Weighted Moving Average (WMA) assigns a decreasing weight to each price point, with the most recent price having the highest weight:

```
WMA = (n × P₁ + (n-1) × P₂ + ... + 1 × Pₙ) / (n + (n-1) + ... + 1)
```

For a 10-point WMA, the denominator would be 10+9+8+...+1 = 55.

### Comparison of Moving Average Types

| Moving Average Type | Responsiveness to Price Changes | Smoothing Effect | Computational Complexity |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Simple (SMA)        | Moderate                        | High              | Low                      |
| Exponential (EMA)   | High                            | Moderate          | Moderate                 |
| Weighted (WMA)      | High                            | Moderate to High  | Moderate to High         |

### Common Window Periods

Different window sizes serve different analytical purposes:

| Window Size | Typical Use                             | Market Timeframe |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|
| 5-10        | Very short-term trend identification     | Intraday         |
| 20          | Short-term trend identification          | Days to Weeks    |
| 50          | Medium-term trend identification         | Weeks to Months  |
| 100         | Medium to long-term trend identification | Months           |
| 200         | Long-term trend identification           | Months to Years  |

Our implementation uses a 10-point window, making it suitable for short-term trend analysis and high-frequency trading applications.

### Trading Signals Based on Moving Averages

Moving averages can generate trading signals in several ways:

1. **Price Crossovers**: Buy when price crosses above the moving average, sell when it crosses below.
2. **Moving Average Crossovers**: Use two moving averages of different periods. Buy when the shorter-period MA crosses above the longer-period MA, sell when it crosses below.
3. **Support/Resistance**: Moving averages often act as dynamic support or resistance levels.
4. **Trend Direction**: The slope of the moving average indicates the trend direction.

These signal generation mechanisms could be implemented as extensions to the current system.

### Module Description

The system consists of two primary modules:

1. **Memory Module**: Implements a 10-element FIFO buffer for storing price data. It manages the addition of new prices and removal of the oldest prices, while tracking the buffer's fill level.

2. **Moving Average FSM**: Implements a finite state machine that calculates the moving average using a rolling sum approach. It activates when the memory buffer is full and produces a new moving average value for each new price update.

### Data Flow

1. New price data arrives at the input of the system.
2. The memory module stores this new price while outputting the oldest price (when the buffer is full).
3. Once the memory buffer contains 10 prices, the moving average FSM begins operation.
4. The FSM updates a running sum by adding the new price and subtracting the oldest price.
5. The moving average is calculated by dividing the sum by 10.
6. The result is output along with a completion signal.
7. The system is then ready for the next price update.

## Implementation Details

### Memory Module

The memory module implements a 10-element FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer for storing price data:

```verilog
module memory (
    input wire clk,               // System clock
    input wire rst,               // Asynchronous reset
    input wire [31:0] new_price,  // Incoming new price
    input wire write_enable,      // Enables writing to memory
    output reg [31:0] oldest_price, // Provides the oldest price for rolling sum
    output wire memory_full,      // Becomes HIGH when FIFO is full
    output reg [319:0] prices_flat, // Flattened 10-price array (debugging)
    output reg [3:0] fifo_data_count // Tracks number of stored prices
);

    reg [31:0] prices[9:0]; // FIFO Memory (10 prices)
    integer i;
    
    assign memory_full = (fifo_data_count >= 10);

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            // Reset logic
        end else if (write_enable) begin
            // FIFO update logic
        end
    end

endmodule
```

Key features of the memory module:

- **Sequential Logic**: Updates occur on the positive edge of the clock
- **Asynchronous Reset**: Complete system reset on assertion of the reset signal
- **Shift Register Implementation**: All prices shift one position when a new price is added
- **Full Indication**: Generates a signal when the buffer contains 10 valid prices
- **Data Count Tracking**: Maintains a count of valid prices in the buffer

### Moving Average FSM

The Moving Average FSM implements the control logic and arithmetic for calculating the moving average:

```verilog
module moving_average_fsm (
    input wire clk,                // System clock
    input wire rst,                // Asynchronous reset
    input wire start,              // Signal to begin calculation
    input wire [31:0] new_price,   // New price data
    input wire [31:0] oldest_price, // Oldest price from FIFO
    output reg [31:0] moving_avg,  // Calculated moving average
    output reg done                // Calculation complete flag
);

    reg [63:0] sum;  // 64-bit sum for precision
    reg [7:0] state;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            // Reset logic
        end else begin
            case (state)
                // State machine logic
            endcase
        end
    end
endmodule
```

Key features of the moving average FSM:

- **Finite State Machine**: Three distinct states for control flow
- **Extended Precision**: 64-bit sum register to prevent overflow issues
- **Rolling Sum Approach**: Efficient calculation by updating sum rather than recalculating
- **Completion Signaling**: Asserts a `done` signal when calculation is complete
- **Synchronous Operation**: All operations triggered by the system clock

### Integration (Testbench)

The testbench demonstrates how the modules are connected in a complete system:

```verilog
module trading_system_tb;

    // Signal declarations
    
    // Module instantiations
    memory memory_inst (
        // Connections
    );

    moving_average_fsm ma_fsm (
        // Connections
    );

    // Clock generation
    always #5 clk = ~clk; // 10ns clock period

    // Test sequence
    initial begin
        // Initialize and reset
        // Generate test data
        // Apply test sequence
        // Verify results
    end

endmodule
```

The testbench provides:

- **Module Instantiation**: Creates and connects both modules
- **Clock Generation**: Generates a 100 MHz clock signal
- **Test Sequence**: Applies 10 test prices and observes results
- **Verification**: Displays final state for manual verification

## Configuration

The current implementation has several configurable aspects that can be modified to suit different requirements.

### Window Size

The current implementation uses a fixed 10-point window for the moving average. To modify this:

1. Update the array size in the memory module:
   ```verilog
   reg [31:0] prices[WINDOW_SIZE-1:0]; // Replace 9 with (WINDOW_SIZE-1)
   ```

2. Update the FIFO count comparison:
   ```verilog
   assign memory_full = (fifo_data_count >= WINDOW_SIZE);
   ```

3. Update the division factor in the FSM:
   ```verilog
   moving_avg <= sum / WINDOW_SIZE;  // Replace 10 with WINDOW_SIZE
   ```

For parameterizable implementation, modify the module declaration:
```verilog
module memory #(
    parameter WINDOW_SIZE = 10
) (
    // Interface signals
);
```

### Data Width

The current implementation uses 32-bit integers for price representation. For different precision:

1. Update signal widths:
   ```verilog
   input wire [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] new_price,
   output reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] oldest_price,
   ```

2. Update array declaration:
   ```verilog
   reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] prices[9:0];
   ```

3. Update sum width (typically 2× data width):
   ```verilog
   reg [2*DATA_WIDTH-1:0] sum;
   ```

For fixed-point representation, additional scaling is needed for division operations.

### Clock Frequency

The system is designed to work across a wide range of clock frequencies. Key considerations when changing clock frequency:

1. **Timing Constraints**: Update constraints in the synthesis files
2. **Division Implementation**: Higher frequencies may require multi-cycle implementation of division
3. **Input Synchronization**: Ensure proper synchronization of external inputs

### Fixed Point Precision

To implement fixed-point precision for decimal values:

1. Determine bit allocation (e.g., 16 bits integer, 16 bits fractional)
2. Implement scaled arithmetic:
   ```verilog
   // Fixed-point division (assuming 16 fractional bits)
   wire [63:0] scaled_sum = sum << 16;  // Shift up for fixed-point
   wire [63:0] fixed_result = scaled_sum / 10;  // Division
   moving_avg <= fixed_result;  // Result has 16 fractional bits
   ```

3. Add appropriate rounding:
   ```verilog
   // Round to nearest
   wire [63:0] round_factor = 1 << 15;  // 0.5 in fixed-point
   wire [63:0] rounded_result = (fixed_result + round_factor) >> 16;
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to instantiate and use the moving average system in a larger design:

```verilog
module trading_platform (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    input wire data_valid,
    input wire [31:0] market_price,
    output wire [31:0] ma_10,
    output wire signal_ready
);

    wire [31:0] oldest_price;
    wire memory_full;
    wire ma_done;

    // Instantiate memory module
    memory memory_inst (
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst),
        .write_enable(data_valid),
        .new_price(market_price),
        .oldest_price(oldest_price),
        .memory_full(memory_full),
        .prices_flat(),  // Not connected if not needed
        .fifo_data_count()  // Not connected if not needed
    );

    // Instantiate moving average FSM
    moving_average_fsm ma_fsm (
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst),
        .start(memory_full & data_valid),
        .new_price(market_price),
        .oldest_price(oldest_price),
        .moving_avg(ma_10),
        .done(ma_done)
    );

    assign signal_ready = ma_done;

endmodule
```

### Integration with Larger Trading Systems

For integration with a complete trading system:

```verilog
module trading_system (
    // System inputs
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    input wire [31:0] market_price,
    input wire price_valid,
    
    // System outputs
    output wire buy_signal,
    output wire sell_signal,
    output wire [31:0] ma_value
);

    // Internal signals
    wire [31:0] oldest_price;
    wire memory_full;
    wire ma_done;
    reg [31:0] prev_ma;
    reg [31:0] prev_price;

    // Moving average components
    memory memory_inst (/* connections */);
    moving_average_fsm ma_fsm (/* connections */);

    // Signal generation logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (rst) begin
            prev_ma <= 0;
            prev_price <= 0;
        end else if (ma_done) begin
            prev_ma <= ma_value;
            prev_price <= market_price;
        end
    end

    // Generate buy signal when price crosses above MA
    assign buy_signal = (prev_price < prev_ma) && (market_price > ma_value);
    
    // Generate sell signal when price crosses below MA
    assign sell_signal = (prev_price > prev_ma) && (market_price < ma_value);

endmodule
```

### Multiple Moving Averages

To implement multiple moving averages (e.g., for a moving average crossover strategy):

```verilog
module ma_crossover_system (
    // System inputs/outputs
);

    // Short-term MA (10-period)
    memory #(.WINDOW_SIZE(10)) memory_short (/* connections */);
    moving_average_fsm #(.WINDOW_SIZE(10)) ma_fsm_short (/* connections */);

    // Long-term MA (20-period)
    memory #(.WINDOW_SIZE(20)) memory_long (/* connections */);
    moving_average_fsm #(.WINDOW_SIZE(20)) ma_fsm_long (/* connections */);

    // Crossover detection
    reg prev_short_above_long;
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (rst) begin
            prev_short_above_long <= 0;
        end else if (ma_short_done && ma_long_done) begin
            prev_short_above_long <= (ma_short > ma_long);
        end
    end

    // Generate signals
    assign buy_signal = !prev_short_above_long && (ma_short > ma_long);
    assign sell_signal = prev_short_above_long && (ma_short < ma_long);

endmodule
```

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Analysis

The system exhibits several key latency components:

1. **Initial Latency**: Before producing the first valid moving average, the system must accumulate 10 prices. At 100 MHz with prices arriving every clock cycle, this initial latency would be 100ns.

2. **Update Latency**: Once the buffer is full, the latency from price input to moving average output is:
   - 1 cycle for memory update
   - 1-3 cycles for moving average calculation (depending on implementation)
   - Total: 2-4 clock cycles (20-40ns at 100 MHz)

For high-frequency trading applications, these latencies are typically acceptable, as they are orders of magnitude lower than network and market latencies.

### Throughput Capabilities

The system is designed to process one new price per clock cycle. At a reference clock frequency of 100 MHz, this translates to a theoretical maximum throughput of 100 million prices per second.

In practice, throughput is typically limited by:
- The rate at which market data arrives
- System integration overhead
- Memory bandwidth for larger designs

### Resource Utilization

Estimated resource utilization on a modern FPGA:

| Resource       | Estimated Usage       | Notes                                 |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Flip-Flops     | ~700-800              | Registers for prices, sum, control    |
| LUTs           | ~400-500              | Combinational logic, arithmetic       |
| DSP Slices     | 0-2                   | Potentially for division              |
| Block RAM      | 0                     | Current design uses distributed RAM   |

These estimates are conservative and actual utilization will vary based on synthesis tools, optimization settings, and target device.

### Power Consumption

Power consumption is influenced by:

1. **Clock Frequency**: Higher frequencies increase dynamic power consumption
2. **Data Activity**: Frequent price updates increase switching activity
3. **Implementation Approach**: Shift register vs. circular buffer affects toggle rates
4. **Division Implementation**: DSP usage vs. LUT-based division affects power

Typical power consumption for this design would be in the 10-100 mW range on modern FPGAs, excluding I/O and peripheral power.

## Extension and Customization

### Supporting Different Moving Average Types

The current implementation can be extended to support different moving average types:

1. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:
   ```verilog
   module ema_calculator (
       // Interface
   );
       parameter ALPHA = 0.1818; // For 10-period EMA: 2/(10+1)
       
       // Fixed-point representation of alpha
       localparam FP_ALPHA = (ALPHA * (2^16)); // Assuming 16 fractional bits
       
       // EMA calculation
       always @(posedge clk) begin
           if (rst) begin
               ema <= 0;
           end else if (start) begin
               // EMA = Price * alpha + EMA * (1-alpha)
               ema <= ((new_price * FP_ALPHA) + (ema * (2^16 - FP_ALPHA))) >> 16;
           end
       end
   endmodule
   ```

2. **Weighted Moving Average (WMA)**:
   ```verilog
   module wma_calculator #(
       parameter WINDOW_SIZE = 10
   ) (
       // Interface
   );
       // WMA implementation
   endmodule
   ```

### Implementing Trading Strategies

The moving average can be combined with other indicators to implement trading strategies:

1. **Moving Average Crossover**:
   ```verilog
   module ma_crossover (
       input wire [31:0] fast_ma,
       input wire [31:0] slow_ma,
       input wire fast_ma_valid,
       input wire slow_ma_valid,
       output reg buy_signal,
       output reg sell_signal
   );
       reg prev_fast_above_slow;
       
       always @(posedge clk) begin
           if (fast_ma_valid && slow_ma_valid) begin
               buy_signal <= !prev_fast_above_slow && (fast_ma > slow_ma);
               sell_signal <= prev_fast_above_slow && (fast_ma < slow_ma);
               prev_fast_above_slow <= (fast_ma > slow_ma);
           end else begin
               buy_signal <= 0;
               sell_signal <= 0;
           end
       end
   endmodule
   ```

2. **Price-MA Crossover**:
   ```verilog
   module price_ma_crossover (
       // Interface
   );
       // Implementation
   endmodule
   ```

### Additional Technical Indicators

The system can be extended with additional technical indicators:

1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
   ```verilog
   module rsi_calculator (
       // Interface
   );
       // RSI implementation
   endmodule
   ```

2. **Bollinger Bands**:
   ```verilog
   module bollinger_bands (
       // Interface
   );
       // Implementation
   endmodule
   ```

## Verification Strategy

### Test Plan

A comprehensive verification strategy should include:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Memory module: Test FIFO operations, full/empty conditions, reset behavior
   - FSM module: Test state transitions, calculation accuracy, edge cases

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - End-to-end data flow
   - Timing relationships between modules
   - Continuous operation with streaming data

3. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Initial fill-up
   - Steady-state operation
   - Reset during operation
   - Edge cases (max/min values)
   - Stress testing (rapid updates)

### Assertion Coverage

Key assertions to implement:

```verilog
// Example assertions using SVA
property fifo_count_max;
    @(posedge clk) fifo_data_count <= 10;
endproperty
assert property(fifo_count_max);

property valid_moving_avg;
    @(posedge clk) (done) |-> (moving_avg <= max_possible_price);
endproperty
assert property(valid_moving_avg);
```

### Reference Model

A Python reference model for validation:

```python
def calculate_sma(prices, window_size=10):
    """Calculate Simple Moving Average for verification"""
    sma_values = []
    for i in range(len(prices)):
        if i < window_size - 1:
            sma_values.append(None)  # Not enough data points
        else:
            window = prices[i-(window_size-1):i+1]
            sma = sum(window) / window_size
            sma_values.append(sma)
    return sma_values
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Incorrect Moving Average Values**:
   - **Symptom**: Moving average values don't match expected results
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Timing issue in FSM calculation
     - Improper FIFO management
     - Division implementation error
   - **Solution**:
     - Verify FSM state sequence
     - Check that sum updates before division
     - Validate FIFO operation with test cases

2. **Timing Failures During Synthesis**:
   - **Symptom**: Synthesis tool reports timing failures
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Clock frequency too high
     - Long combinational paths (especially in division)
     - Reset synchronization issues
   - **Solution**:
     - Decrease clock frequency
     - Pipeline complex operations
     - Use synchronous reset

3. **FIFO Operation Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Oldest price value incorrect or inconsistent
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - FIFO shift logic error
     - Counter management issues
   - **Solution**:
     - Verify FIFO shift operations in simulation
     - Check counter increment/decrement logic

### Debugging Tips

1. **Use Waveform Analysis**:
   - Observe key signals: `sum`, `oldest_price`, `moving_avg`
   - Check state transitions and timing relationships
   - Verify FIFO operation sequence

2. **Add Debug Ports**:
   - The `prices_flat` output provides visibility into all stored prices
   - Consider adding additional debug outputs for internal state

3. **Incremental Testing**:
   - Test memory module independently
   - Test FSM with controlled inputs
   - Integrate and test complete system

### FAQs

**Q: Why use a hardware implementation instead of software?**
A: Hardware implementations offer significantly lower latency and higher throughput, crucial for high-frequency trading where microseconds matter.

**Q: How accurate is the moving average calculation?**
A: The implementation uses integer arithmetic, so there may be rounding errors when dealing with fractional values. For enhanced precision, consider implementing fixed-point arithmetic.

**Q: Can the system handle market data bursts?**
A: The current implementation processes one price per clock cycle, which is typically sufficient for most market data rates. For handling bursts, consider adding an input FIFO buffer.

**Q: How does reset affect ongoing calculations?**
A: The asynchronous reset immediately clears all registers and returns the system to its initial state, discarding any in-progress calculations.

**Q: What's the maximum window size supported?**
A: The current implementation is fixed at 10 points, but it could be parameterized. Practical limits depend on available FPGA resources and timing constraints.

|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| High Volatility  | 5-10        | Every tick       | Faster response to price changes     |

| Low Volatility   | 20-50       | Periodic         | Smoother curves, longer-term trends  |

### Mathematical Foundation

The Simple Moving Average is a finite impulse response filter with equal coefficients:

$$\text{SMA}_n(t) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} P(t-i)$$

Where:
- $\text{SMA}_n(t)$ is the moving average at time $t$ with window size $n$
- $P(t-i)$ is the price at time $t-i$

The recursive update formula used in our implementation is:

$$\text{SMA}_n(t) = \text{SMA}_n(t-1) + \frac{P(t) - P(t-n)}{n}$$

Or, using the sum directly:

$$\text{Sum}(t) = \text{Sum}(t-1) + P(t) - P(t-n)$$
$$\text{SMA}_n(t) = \frac{\text{Sum}(t)}{n}$$

This recursive approach is computationally efficient, requiring only two additions/subtractions and one division per update, regardless of window size.
