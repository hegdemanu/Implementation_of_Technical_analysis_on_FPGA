# RSI Hardware Implementation using Verilog

## üìä Overview
This project implements a hardware-based Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculator using Verilog for FPGA implementation. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, commonly used in financial technical analysis. This implementation uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) approach to manage the computational workflow and a FIFO buffer to store price data.

## üîç Technical Architecture

The system consists of two primary modules:
1. `price_fifo.v` - A customizable First-In-First-Out buffer for storing price data
2. `rsi_fsm.v` - A Finite State Machine that controls the RSI calculation process

### System Parameters
- Price history depth: 20 samples
- Price data width: 16 bits
- Output RSI range: 0-100 (8-bit representation)

## üíæ Price FIFO Module Detailed Documentation

The `price_fifo` module implements a circular buffer that stores price data with configurable depth and width.

### Parameters
- `DEPTH`: Number of entries in the FIFO (default: 20)
- `WIDTH`: Bit width of each entry (default: 16)

### Ports
- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: System clock signal
  - `rst`: Asynchronous reset signal (active high)
  - `wr_en`: Write enable signal
  - `rd_en`: Read enable signal
  - `din[WIDTH-1:0]`: Data input (price value)
- **Outputs**:
  - `dout[WIDTH-1:0]`: Data output (price value)
  - `full`: Flag indicating FIFO is full
  - `empty`: Flag indicating FIFO is empty

### Internal Registers
- `mem[0:DEPTH-1]`: Memory array for storing price values
- `wr_ptr`: Write pointer (5 bits to address up to 32 entries)
- `rd_ptr`: Read pointer (5 bits to address up to 32 entries)
- `count`: Current number of elements in the FIFO (6 bits to represent up to 32 entries)

### Behavior
The FIFO operates on the positive edge of the clock or reset signal:
- On reset: All pointers and counters are reset to zero
- Write operation: When `wr_en` is asserted and the FIFO is not full, the data at `din` is stored at the current write pointer position, the write pointer is incremented, and the count is increased
- Read operation: When `rd_en` is asserted and the FIFO is not empty, the data at the current read pointer position is output to `dout`, the read pointer is incremented, and the count is decreased

## ‚öôÔ∏è RSI FSM Module Detailed Documentation

The `rsi_fsm` module implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) that controls the process of calculating the Relative Strength Index (RSI).

### Ports

  - `start`: Signal to start the RSI calculation process
  - `price_in[15:0]`: Price input data
  - `new_price`: Signal indicating a new price is available
- **Outputs**:

## üîÑ FSM State Machine Design In-Depth Analysis

The RSI calculation is managed through a 6-state Finite State Machine. The state transitions and operations are carefully designed to handle the sequential nature of RSI calculation. Let's examine each state in detail:

### 1. IDLE State (3'b000)
The IDLE state is the default starting state of the FSM and the state to which it returns after completing an RSI calculation.

**Behavior:**
- System waits for the `start` signal to begin a new RSI calculation
- When `start` is asserted:
  - Reset counters and accumulators: `gain_sum`, `loss_sum`, `sample_cnt`
  - Clear the `done` flag
  - Transition to the FILL_FIFO state

**Flag Operations:**
- No flags are modified unless transitioning to the next state

**Transition Conditions:**
- If `start` is asserted: ‚Üí FILL_FIFO
- Otherwise: remain in IDLE

### 2. FILL_FIFO State (3'b001)
The FILL_FIFO state handles loading the price data into the FIFO buffer until it reaches capacity.

**Behavior:**
- If a new price is available (`new_price` is asserted) and the FIFO is not full:
  - Enable writing to the FIFO by asserting `fifo_wr_en`
- Once the FIFO is full:
  - Begin reading from the FIFO by asserting `fifo_rd_en`
  - Set the `read_delay` flag to handle the one-cycle delay in FIFO read operations
  - Transition to the READ_INIT state

**Flag Operations:**
- `fifo_wr_en`: Set when new price available and FIFO not full
- `fifo_rd_en`: Set when FIFO becomes full
- `read_delay`: Set when initiating first read operation

**Transition Conditions:**
- If FIFO becomes full: ‚Üí READ_INIT
- Otherwise: remain in FILL_FIFO

### 3. READ_INIT State (3'b010)
The READ_INIT state initializes the first price value for subsequent comparisons.

**Behavior:**
- Clear the FIFO read enable signal (`fifo_rd_en`)
- If the `read_delay` flag is set:
  - Capture the first price as `prev_price`
  - Clear the `read_delay` flag
  - Transition to the COMPARE state

**Flag Operations:**
- `fifo_rd_en`: Cleared
- `read_delay`: Cleared when first price is captured
- `prev_price`: Updated with the first price value from the FIFO

**Transition Conditions:**
- When `read_delay` is set and the first price is captured: ‚Üí COMPARE
- Otherwise: remain in READ_INIT

### 4. COMPARE State (3'b100)
The COMPARE state determines whether to continue processing price data or to complete the calculation.

**Behavior:**
- If not all samples have been processed (`sample_cnt < 19`) and the FIFO is not empty:
  - Enable reading from the FIFO by asserting `fifo_rd_en`
  - Set the `read_delay` flag to handle the one-cycle delay in FIFO read operations
  - Transition to the READ_WAIT state
- Otherwise:
  - Transition to the DONE state

**Flag Operations:**
- `fifo_rd_en`: Set when more samples need processing
- `read_delay`: Set when initiating a read operation

**Transition Conditions:**
- If `sample_cnt < 19` and FIFO not empty: ‚Üí READ_WAIT
- Otherwise: ‚Üí DONE

### 5. READ_WAIT State (3'b011)
The READ_WAIT state performs the core RSI calculation by comparing consecutive price values.

**Behavior:**
- Clear the FIFO read enable signal (`fifo_rd_en`)
- If the `read_delay` flag is set:
  - Capture the current price as `curr_price`
  - Compare `curr_price` with `prev_price`:
    - If `curr_price > prev_price`: Add the difference to `gain_sum`
    - If `curr_price < prev_price`: Add the difference to `loss_sum`
  - Update `prev_price` with the current price
  - Increment the sample counter
  - Clear the `read_delay` flag
  - Transition back to the COMPARE state

**Flag Operations:**
- `fifo_rd_en`: Cleared
- `curr_price`: Updated with the latest price from the FIFO
- `gain_sum`: Incremented if current price is higher than previous
- `loss_sum`: Incremented if current price is lower than previous
- `prev_price`: Updated with the current price for the next comparison
- `sample_cnt`: Incremented to track progress
- `read_delay`: Cleared after processing

**Transition Conditions:**
- When processing is complete: ‚Üí COMPARE

### 6. DONE State (3'b101)
The DONE state calculates the final RSI value and signals completion.

**Behavior:**
- Calculate the RSI using the formula: RSI = 100 * gain_sum / (gain_sum + loss_sum)
  - If `gain_sum + loss_sum > 0`: Calculate RSI normally
  - Otherwise: Set RSI to 0 to avoid division by zero
- Assert the `done` flag to signal completion
- Transition back to the IDLE state

**Flag Operations:**
- `rsi`: Updated with the calculated RSI value
- `done`: Asserted to indicate calculation completion

**Transition Conditions:**
- Always: ‚Üí IDLE

## üìà RSI Calculation Method

The RSI is calculated using the following approach:
1. Store 20 consecutive price samples in the FIFO
2. For each pair of consecutive prices:
   - If current price > previous price: Add the difference to gain_sum
   - If current price < previous price: Add the difference to loss_sum
3. Calculate RSI using the formula: RSI = 100 * gain_sum / (gain_sum + loss_sum)

### Sample Calculation
For the sample prices: [100, 98, 101, 99, 102, 100, 103, 101, 104, 102, 105, 103, 106, 104, 107, 105, 108, 106, 109, 107]

The price changes are:
- 98-100 = -2 (loss: 2)
- 101-98 = 3 (gain: 3)
- 99-101 = -2 (loss: 2)
- 102-99 = 3 (gain: 3)
- 100-102 = -2 (loss: 2)
- 103-100 = 3 (gain: 3)
- 101-103 = -2 (loss: 2)
- 104-101 = 3 (gain: 3)
- 102-104 = -2 (loss: 2)
- 105-102 = 3 (gain: 3)
- 103-105 = -2 (loss: 2)
- 106-103 = 3 (gain: 3)
- 104-106 = -2 (loss: 2)
- 107-104 = 3 (gain: 3)
- 105-107 = -2 (loss: 2)
- 108-105 = 3 (gain: 3)
- 106-108 = -2 (loss: 2)
- 109-106 = 3 (gain: 3)
- 107-109 = -2 (loss: 2)

Total gain sum = 27
Total loss sum = 18

RSI = 100 * 27 / (27 + 18) = 100 * 27 / 45 = 60

## üö© Critical Flags and Control Signals

### Main Control Flags
- `start`: Initiates the RSI calculation process
- `done`: Signals completion of the RSI calculation
- `new_price`: Indicates a new price is available for processing

### FIFO Control Flags
- `fifo_wr_en`: Controls writing to the FIFO
- `fifo_rd_en`: Controls reading from the FIFO
- `fifo_full`: Indicates the FIFO has reached capacity
- `fifo_empty`: Indicates the FIFO contains no data

### Internal Processing Flags
- `read_delay`: Manages the one-cycle delay in FIFO read operations
- `sample_cnt`: Tracks the number of processed samples

## üîß Implementation Considerations

### Timing Considerations
- The FIFO read operation introduces a one-cycle delay, which is handled by the `read_delay` flag
- State transitions are synchronized to the positive edge of the clock

### Resource Utilization
- Memory usage: 20 price entries √ó 16 bits = 320 bits
- State encoding: 3 bits for 6 states
- Arithmetic operations: Addition and division for RSI calculation

### Potential Enhancements
1. Parameterized RSI period (currently fixed at 20)
2. Fixed-point arithmetic for more precise RSI calculation
3. Exponential moving average implementation for Exponential RSI
4. Pipelined architecture for higher throughput

## üìù Usage and Integration
## üß™ Testing and Verification

### Testbench Overview
The project includes a comprehensive testbench (`rsi_testbench.v`) that verifies the functionality of the RSI implementation.

### Testbench Architecture
```verilog
module rsi_testbench;
    reg clk = 0, rst = 1, start = 0, new_price = 0;
    reg [15:0] price_in = 0;
    wire done;
    wire [7:0] rsi;

    rsi_fsm uut (
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst),
        .start(start),
        .price_in(price_in),
        .new_price(new_price),
        .done(done),
        .rsi(rsi)
    );

    always #5 clk = ~clk;

    // Test implementation
    // ...
endmodule
```

### Test Sequence
1. Initialize system with reset asserted
2. Generate a test price sequence with alternating gains and losses
3. De-assert reset and pulse the start signal
4. Feed each price into the system with the new_price signal
5. Wait for the done signal to be asserted
6. Verify the calculated RSI value

### Test Data Pattern
The testbench uses a specially crafted price sequence where:
- Starting price: 100
- Even indices: Price increases by 3
- Odd indices: Price decreases by 2

This pattern creates a predictable RSI calculation with known gain and loss values.

### Running the Testbench
The testbench can be executed using standard Verilog simulation tools:
```
$ iverilog -o rsi_sim rsi_fsm.v price_fifo.v rsi_testbench.v
$ vvp rsi_sim
```

### Expected Results
With the provided test pattern, the expected RSI value is 60, matching our sample calculation example.
```
RSI Value = 60
```
### Module Instantiation
```verilog
rsi_fsm rsi_calculator (
    .clk(system_clock),
    .rst(system_reset),
    .start(begin_calculation),
    .price_in(current_price),
    .new_price(price_valid),
    .done(calculation_complete),
    .rsi(rsi_output)
);
```

### Operational Sequence
1. Assert `rst` to initialize the system
2. De-assert `rst` to begin operation
3. Feed prices by setting `price_in` and asserting `new_price`
4. Once 20 prices have been stored, assert `start`
5. Wait for `done` to be asserted
6. Read the calculated RSI value from the `rsi` output
